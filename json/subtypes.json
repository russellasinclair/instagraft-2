A troop has a single pool of Hit Points, a single initiative modifier, and a single EAC and KAC. A troop attempts saving throws as a single creature.  A single troop usually occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (if it is made up of flying creatures) 20 feet on a side, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is shapable, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reffect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size and gear. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies without impediment and vice versa, though such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for its component creatures. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.  Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration, such as Computers, within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful DC 20 Will saving throw.  The exact number of a troop’s component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 10 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures (for example, a troop of Large creatures would occupy a 30-foot-square area, equal to a Colossal creature).  Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, not all of these creatures’ gear will survive the rigors of combat. As a result, treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of how much treasure is awarded for an encounter with the troop, as determined by the troop’s CR on Table 11–4: Wealth Gains per Encounter on page 391 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook.

The first time after its daily preparations that an anunnaki uses this ability against a specific creature, it costs no Resolve Points; otherwise it costs 1 Resolve Point to use. » Devolution: The target is afflicted with devolution corruption (see page 280) if it wasn’t already and gain 1d8 corruption points for every 3 CR that the anunnaki has. If the target was uplifted by an anunnaki’s shape sapience, the anunnaki can instead remove all effects of that ability, reverting them to their original state. » Mnemonic Editing: The target falls unconscious for 1 hour. If the target is already unconscious, the duration of this effect resets and the anunnaki can modify a number of years of the target’s memory equal to its CR, acting as modify memory except the effect is instantaneous and can only be reversed by psychic surgery or a similarly powerful effect. Instead of modifying the target’s memory in one of the ways described by modify memory, an anunnaki can change the creature’s statistics as if using a mnemonic editor. This ability doesn’t count towards the number of times that the target can benefit from a mnemonic editor of any type. Unlike other uses of modify memory, editing a creature’s statistics takes 1 hour, at the end of which the creature’s statistics are altered. If the anunnaki is interrupted before this process is completed, the target awakens feeling disoriented but is otherwise unchanged. » Uplift: The target’s Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores increase to 2d4+3, rolling separately for each ability score. If the target’s ability score (or ability modifier) is naturally higher than the result rolled, the target gains a +1d3 enhancement bonus to rolls and checks associated with that ability score instead.
